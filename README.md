stickyscroll
============

**Fixed position vertically scrollable area whose contents 'parallax'-scroll to match the containing document's scrolling.**

This is a progressive enhancement specifically useful for sidebars that are taller than the browser window but want to remain visible/fixed/stuck/onscreen even with very long page content.
